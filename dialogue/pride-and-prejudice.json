",{"#":"{\"name\": \"Mr. Bennet\", \"mood\": \"happy\"}"},"\n","^Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week.

",{"#":"{\"name\": \"Mr. Bennet\", \"mood\": \"happy\"}"},"\n","^My dear Mr. Bennet, how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.

Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes. ",{"#":"{\"name\": \"Mrs. Bennet\", \"mood\": \"happy\"}"},"\n","^I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the party. ",{"#":"{\"name\": \"Mr. Bennet\", \"mood\": \"happy\"}"},"\n","^My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now.

",{"#":"{\"name\": \"Mr. Bennet\", \"mood\": \"happy\"}"},"\n","^I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.
